# Menigo
Menigo is a lightweight "under construction" page for you to use under the MIT License. It is only HTML/CSS in order to be as fast as possible. Of course, it's also fully responsive. It is not ready for accessibility though, so you'll have to do that on your own. Check out the full version of Menigo [here](http://http://deanpapastrat.github.io/menigo/).

If you have questions/suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request!
